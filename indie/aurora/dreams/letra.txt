Dreams
AURORA

I've needed so much, with nothing to touch
Floating from earth
Another bridge burned, a mother concerned
Come back to the world

In my dreams
Everything's more quiet than here
In my dreams
Everything I feel disappears

The night became new and out of it grew
A hymn of the pearl
Don't lie to yourself, don't lie to the world
Don't lie to a girl
When your shadows were forgiven, I abandoned your religion
And I knew that I would never come back
So tired and so aimless, I travelled through the darkness
So my path would be impossible to track

In my dreams
Everything's more quiet than here
In my dreams
Everything I feel disappears

Learn my body and my poems
And repeat them like you own them
Like the arrow and the willow, we all bend
Let the mothers and the daughters climb out of the waters
Like the needle and the cockroach, we mend

In my dreams
Everything's more quiet than here
In my dreams
Everything I feel disappears
