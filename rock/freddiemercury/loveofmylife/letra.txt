Love Of My Life
Freddie Mercury

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

Love of my life don't leave me
You've taken my love and now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You'll remember when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you, I still love you

Hurry back, hurry back
Don't take it away from me because
You don't know what it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Uuh, yeah
